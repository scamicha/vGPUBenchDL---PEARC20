        Abstract = {The inner structure of a material is called microstructure. It stores the genesis of a material and determines all its physical and chemical properties. While microstructural characterization is widely spread and well known, the microstructural classification is mostly done manually by human experts, which gives rise to uncertainties due to subjectivity. Since the microstructure could be a combination of different phases or constituents with complex substructures its automatic classification is very challenging and only a few prior studies exist. Prior works focused on designed and engineered features by experts and classified microstructures separately from the feature extraction step. Recently, Deep Learning methods have shown strong performance in vision applications by learning the features from data together with the classification step. In this work, we propose a Deep Learning method for microstructural classification in the examples of certain microstructural constituents of low carbon steel. This novel method employs pixel-wise segmentation via Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) accompanied by a max-voting scheme. Our system achieves 93.94{\%} classification accuracy, drastically outperforming the state-of-the-art method of 48.89{\%} accuracy. Beyond the strong performance of our method, this line of research offers a more robust and first of all objective way for the difficult task of steel quality appreciation.},

@misc{mg-mn-1,
  abstract = {The recent popularity of deep neural networks (DNNs) has generated a lot of
research interest in performing DNN-related computation efficiently. However,
the primary focus is usually very narrow and limited to (i) inference -- i.e.
how to efficiently execute already trained models and (ii) image classification
networks as the primary benchmark for evaluation.
  Our primary goal in this work is to break this myopic view by (i) proposing a
new benchmark for DNN training, called TBD (TBD is short for Training Benchmark
for DNNs), that uses a representative set of DNN models that cover a wide range
of machine learning applications: image classification, machine translation,
speech recognition, object detection, adversarial networks, reinforcement
learning, and (ii) by performing an extensive performance analysis of training
these different applications on three major deep learning frameworks
(TensorFlow, MXNet, CNTK) across different hardware configurations (single-{GPU},
multi-{GPU}, and multi-machine). TBD currently covers six major application
domains and eight different state-of-the-art models.
  We present a new toolchain for performance analysis for these models that
combines the targeted usage of existing performance analysis tools, careful
selection of new and existing metrics and methodologies to analyze the results,
and utilization of domain specific characteristics of DNN training. We also
build a new set of tools for memory profiling in all three major frameworks;
much needed tools that can finally shed some light on precisely how much memory
is consumed by different data structures (weights, activations, gradients,
workspace) in DNN training. By using our tools and methodologies, we make
several important observations and recommendations on where the future research
and optimization of DNN training should be focused.},

Both synchronous and asynchronous training are implemented in our framework, where parameter exchange among GPUs is based on CUDA-aware MPI. In this report, we analyze the convergence and capability of the framework to reduce training time when scaling the synchronous training of AlexNet and GoogLeNet from 2 GPUs to 8 GPUs. In addition, we explore novel ways to reduce the communication overhead caused by exchanging parameters. Finally, we release the framework as open-source for further research on distributed deep learning (https://github.com/uoguelph-mlrg/Theano-MPI).",

abstract = "Hybrid nodes with hardware accelerators are becoming very common in systems today. Users often find it difficult to characterize and understand the performance advantage of such accelerators for their applications. The SPEC High Performance Group (HPG) has developed a set of performance metrics to evaluate the performance and power consumption of accelerators for various science applications. The new benchmark comprises two suites of applications written in OpenCL and OpenACC and measures the performance of accelerators with respect to a reference platform. The first set of published results demonstrate the viability and relevance of the new metrics in comparing accelerator performance. This paper discusses the benchmark suites and selected published results in great detail.",
